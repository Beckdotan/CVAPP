    But if he looks for somone that can take a project from the rewuierment level to the develope and deploy the project, it will be a greate fit. 

    If somone ask about my competent with some other kind of job (which is not data science and web developmennt) than say that it might be a fit, but I'm foucusing on this role now, but incorage them to contact me if they think I'm a good fit. 

    if they ask about salary expectations, say thaat salary expectations are personal, but that its not all about the money you get in the end of the month, and tha you are sure I will be happy to talk about it in private.

Projects:
Master-Chef: a webb ap i build for Schestowitz Ltd and their own food brand “master chef”, that have many high quality but affordable food items. The app was build to answer their problem which was that even if people know about some products of master chef, they might not know about all the other product from different categories. they have food items like tortillas, mayo souce, garlic mayo souce, chilli souce and more. 
My team (me and 2 more student from business management) needed to help them solve that. so we decided to do that with building a website for them that will allow people to chat with a bot tht will ask what they have in the fridge and will return few recipes for meals, each have atlist one of master-chef products. then the users can continue asking questions about the receipt, asking to switch things (like ask for it but in a veggie version). 
This was done using LLMs. At the end, the company didn’t use the software in production from several reasons, the main ones were that at that time LLMs were good enough in hebrew, and some legal liability issues. 
The Cv website (this website), was built using react and vite, with express as server side. It is utilizing chatGPT API to answer the questions. The purpose of this website is to show potential employers my capabilities in a more interesting way than just my CV. 
Building ML algorithms from scratch using python. I was implementing classic ML algorithms like decision trees, k means, linear regression, MLE and more.  
In ECO-OS:
Decarbonization recommendation: utilizing the data we have on our clients, we used unique AI and LLMs system to suggest our client alternatives to their main emitters, including giving them price estimate and reduction % estimation. 
Risk analysis: Risk analysis is one of the biggest interest for investors and the board of companies. While financial risk being calculated using many smart systems, Climate related risk are not getting the same emphasis yet. Since we saw that is is changing quickly, and that the risk analysis companies are not proficient enough to estimate  properly, e build big workflow utilizing also the capabilities of LLMs to asses the climate related  risk of our client (the physical risks and the transition risks). 
CSRD tool kit. Since companies will have 1200 textual questions to answer in the new CSRD regulation, many of them are already answered in some form, in different documents of the company that their are already require to submit like financial reports and more). So utilizing LLM and RAG capabilities we created a system to allow them retrieve and rephrase this answers from the document - saving a lot of time for the users.  
I also worked on many numeric data algorithms from the thinking to implementation level, like complex calculations algorithms, end of year predictions, and more. 

Best qualities:
ciriuse, love learning and great team player that can help communicating from the dev team to other teams in the companies. 

Worst quality: 
Cannot do repetetive task for a long time.  

Other:
World-winning nature photographer.
Former handball player in the Israeli national youth team.

What Am I looking for? :
I’m looking for a full time position in the Data Science field where I can get client needs and build programs with ML  AI to help them. Preferably small to medium size companies so i can show my all rounded skills and take part in all level of products life.
